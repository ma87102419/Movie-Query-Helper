# Movie-Query-Helper
This project is designed to assist users in finding movies and other further information such as theater's location, movie time, movie categories, etc. With this helper, we don't need to search for movie-associated information on many webpages to compare time one by one. Instead, we can acquire adequate information about a list of the lateste popular movies.

## Details
This project is divided to two parts:

1. Crawler
2. Main function and GUI
